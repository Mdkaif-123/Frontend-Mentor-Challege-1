## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React JSX Component
- Tailwind Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Through completing the Frontend Mentor challenge where I built a QR code page using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of web development. Firstly, my proficiency in Next.js significantly improved as I successfully implemented a project with this React framework. I delved into its features, potentially exploring server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG). Additionally, mastering Tailwind CSS was a highlight, as I refined my skills in efficiently styling the application using the utility-first approach. The seamless integration of QR codes into the page showcased my ability to work with diverse technologies. Overall, this project not only enhanced my technical skills but also underscored the importance of practical application in reinforcing theoretical knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Next.Js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/) - Used by some of the world's largest companies, Next.js enables you to create full-stack Web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-defined utility classes for styling.
